CDFM's summary:
Construct an H-matrix and compute matrix-vector products of the form B*x, B(rs,:)*x, and B(rs,cs)*x(cs). An H-matrix is one way to compress the matrix relating slip to stress in a BEM simulation of a fault. The package hmmvpex contains practical usage examples. (Previous major version.)
